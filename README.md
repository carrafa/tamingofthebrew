# Welcome to Taming of the Brew! This app helps people identify their flavor preferences so they can find new beers to try based on their personal taste. 

## We hope this app changes the way people who only buy and try a limited number of beers to try new brews that they know they will enjoy!

## Built by Joshua Carrafa, Ash Hofferber, Kyle Stengline, and Ethan Steiner.

Inspiration: Hard to try new beers or know if you will like them. Beer of choice not in stock/carried in store. Not knowing which beer to bring to a party.

What it does: Uses interactive taste mapping technology to map your flavor preferences and then selects from a database of ~15,000 beers to recommend matches that you will love to drink!

How we built it: Using the MEHN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, Handlebars.js, Node.js - using d3 interactions and animations for the taste map. API calls to 'untappd' database of beers. 

Challenges we ran into: Time crunch - we built this in less than 24 hours!

Accomplishments that I'm proud of: d3 interactions, taste mapping visual interface, logic for taste mapping, seeding the database with different beers

What we learned: Easy interaction makes for a fun and useful app! Brew recommendations are a fun and social way to meet people and make new friends - especially the obscure craft brews.

What's next for Taming of the Brew: Adding user profiles to save the taste map preferences. Adding different taste maps for each user based on mood. Crowd-sourcing taste map data to provide average of brew taste ratings from all users. Adding location mapping to find the brewery of, and the store that carries the recommended brews that is closest to you. Add food pairing data when selecting recommended brews.
